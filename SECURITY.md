## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you see a vulnerability with RoXploit software, please contact us by emailing roxploitreports@outlook.com and add as much as you have about the vulnerability.
We recommend adding:
* Your GitHub profile link
* Your Roblox Username or Discord tag
* When you found the bug
* Any steps to reproduce it
* If the bug is relating to a Roblox bug (check devforum)


We go through **EXTENSIVE** testing and research so making false reports wastes resources and time resulting in more unnecesarry updates!


If your request has been accepted, we will e-mail you back so do not use an anonymous email or temporary disposable email with thanks and what we have found

If your request has been declined, we will e-mail you back on why your request has been declined.

Your vulnerability report will also be published in the vulnerabilitys.txt file, which will include:
* Your GitHub name
